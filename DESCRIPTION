Maintainer: Nicolas Dickinson <dickinson@washnote.com>
Description: As a convenience, this package reproduces a snapshot of the JMP WASH household, WASH in schools and WASH in health care facilities data that is normally available in Excel sheets on https://washdata.org. 
    The data is loaded in the package at build time to avoid burdening washdata.org with unnecessary requests since the data is updated at the moment no more often than once a year.
    Some helper functions are provided to access specific data and indicators.
